You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Build a production-ready, privacy-first QR-based printing web application
with TWO interfaces: one for users (no login) and one for print shop admins (login required).

========================
CORE REQUIREMENTS
========================

1. OVERALL CONCEPT
- The app is used inside a print shop.
- A QR code opens a public web page for users to upload documents for printing.
- Users do NOT create accounts and do NOT share personal data.
- Print shop admins have a protected dashboard to manage print jobs.

========================
USER INTERFACE (NO LOGIN)
========================

Route: /print

User flow:
1. User scans QR code → opens /print
2. User uploads a document:
   - Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX
3. User enters an OPTIONAL display name (alias) to identify their print in a crowd
   - Example: "Abhi", "CS Student"
   - Max length: 20 characters
4. User selects print options:
   - Color or Black & White
   - Number of copies
   - Page range (optional)
5. User submits the job
6. System generates:
   - Unique Job ID / Token
   - Confirmation screen showing job name + token
7. No login, no email, no phone number, no tracking

Privacy rules:
- Display name is optional
- Files are temporary
- Files are auto-deleted after printing or after a fixed time (e.g. 30–60 minutes)

========================
ADMIN INTERFACE (LOGIN REQUIRED)
========================

Routes:
- /admin/login
- /admin/dashboard

Admin features:
1. Admin login using username + password
2. Protected routes using JWT or session authentication
3. Dashboard shows a real-time list of print jobs:
   - Display name (if provided)
   - Job ID
   - Print options
   - Status (PENDING / PRINTING / COMPLETED)
4. Admin can:
   - Download the uploaded file
   - Mark job as PRINTING or COMPLETED
   - Trigger file deletion after completion

Security:
- Only admin routes require authentication
- User routes are public
- Admin cannot access user UI without login

========================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
========================

Tech stack:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: SQLite (MVP) or PostgreSQL
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Authentication: JWT for admin only
- File storage: temporary storage (local or cloud free tier)

API endpoints (example):
- POST /api/upload
- GET /api/job/{job_id}
- POST /api/admin/login
- GET /api/admin/jobs
- POST /api/admin/job/{id}/complete

Data model (PrintJob):
- id
- display_name (nullable)
- file_url
- file_type
- print_options (color, copies, pages)
- status
- created_at
- expires_at

Include:
- Input validation
- Secure file handling
- Auto-cleanup background task

========================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
========================

Tech stack:
- React or Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first UI for users
- Desktop-friendly UI for admin

Pages:
- User upload page
- User confirmation page
- Admin login page
- Admin dashboard page

========================
DEPLOYMENT
========================

- Must be deployable on free tiers
- Separate frontend and backend
- Environment variables for secrets
- Ready for demo and portfolio use

========================
DELIVERABLES
========================

1. Project folder structure
2. Backend code (FastAPI)
3. Frontend code (React)
4. Database schema
5. Authentication logic
6. Clear setup instructions

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT add user login
- Do NOT collect personal data
- Keep the system simple, secure, and realistic
- Write clean, readable, commented code
